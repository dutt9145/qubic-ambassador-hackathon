## 🚀 Short Summary

The **Qubic USA Ambassador Hackathon — “Revolutions”** is a global builder event focused on expanding the Qubic ecosystem by challenging developers to create the **Ultimate Qubic Wallet** — a high-performance, feeless, Web3-native wallet for RPC-20 tokens, gaming, AI contracts, staking, analytics, and ecosystem tools.

The hackathon progresses through four major phases:

1. **Preparation** — Funding, infrastructure, documentation, and portal development  
2. **Promotion & Onboarding** — Ambassador outreach, education tracks, workshops, and developer training  
3. **Execution (March 2026)** — A 6-week build sprint with milestone demos and GitHub-verified submissions  
4. **Evaluation** — Livestream demos, judging, awards, and ecosystem onboarding for top projects  

A total prize pool of **30B QUBIC** is distributed among winners, including Grand Prize, Runner-Ups, and Honorable Mentions.

The hackathon reinforces Qubic’s mission to deliver:  
- Feeless, scalable decentralized compute  
- On-chain AI and provably fair randomness  
- High-performance gaming and RPC-20 tooling  
- Bare-metal optimized infrastructure  
- A thriving, developer-first builder ecosystem  

After the event, the hackathon portal evolves into a **permanent bounty hub and developer accelerator**, supporting ongoing innovation across the Qubic network.
